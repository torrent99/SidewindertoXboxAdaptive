# SidewindertoXboxAdaptive


This is heavy modification of https://code.google.com/archive/p/sw3dprousb/source/default/source

Specifically it is to make a Precision Pro work on an XBOX Adaptive controller with all 8 buttons (default only works for 4 buttons).

It has also been modded to make the HAT  use buttons 5-8 (the base buttons still work too).

NOTE THIS WILL NOT SHOW AS A JOYSTICK IN WINDOWS 10!!!!
